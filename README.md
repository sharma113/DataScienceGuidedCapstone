## Problem Identification

The Question: Can we develop a model that will accurately predict whether a patient is a high risk of dying during the hospitalization.

The Audience: The results will be presented to the Hospitalist service of the local community hospital.

The Data: The Dataset was downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset represents 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks. It includes over 50 features representing patient healthcare data. 

The Modeling Response: Expired Patients = 1, Non-Expired Patients = 0

The Model: Random Forest with a Recall score of 98% and ROC AUC score of 96%

The Deliverables: Jupyter notebooks of data wrangling through modeling, a final report, and a presentation
